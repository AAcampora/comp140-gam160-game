_This is my concept pitch for my idea of an Arcade videogame.

the game is going to be called:

## A Dragon Against Thousands!!!

This game is going to be an **arcade fighting** game with an Element of **ddr (Dance dance revolution)**


### The Game
The aim of the game is to go trought waves and waves of enemies from the weaker one to the stronger one. The player will have to mantain control and rihtym with the game, and he will be required to be pin point precise whith their strikes, and to do this, you will 
have to use a special controller, of my creation. This controller has multiple points where you will be required to punch in order to score points and to advance the game. The punching pads will inluminate to signal the player has to punch that point, and the in game screen is going to suggest where as well. More the player goes trought the game, more the game is going to become faster and challenging. 

### The controller 
The controller itself is a huge board of wood/metal with pads mounted on top, under the pads there will be placed peizo sensors, which activate when in presence of high vibration/shock, which are going to send a message to the arduino which then is going to comunicate with the game. The board will be secured in front of a cabinet, which will have a counter weight on the bottom (at least 30/50 kg of weight) in order to not make the cabinet tip over cos of the multiple bashes. Also, i was thinking to add to the design shock dampners to put between the board and the cabinet, in order to dissipate the energy produced by the player. The player will be required to wear boxing gloves, in order to protect his hand and to damp even more the punch to the machine. The cabinet will be probably a structure of metal/wood, depending on the aviability of material. As a second sprint for this cabinet, if I am able in time, I would like to add a custom ddr mat on the floor, and add dodge mechanics to the game, like "if the enemy strikes from the left, the player has to step on the left in order to  doge it" and so forward. 

### the challenges
The software part of this project will be a challenge for me, because I never fiddled with rythm based games before, but I belive the harder part will be coding the Arduino board, which is something I have no experience with. 
The controller will be fun to build. I Always dreamt of seeing one of my games beign mounted on a arcade machine and being played by other people.
