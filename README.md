Hello Good sir 

This is my concept pitch for my idea of an Arcade videogame.

the game is going to be called:


A Dragon Against Thousands

This game is going to be an arcade fighting game with an Element of ddr (Dance dance revolution)

The aim of the game is to go trought waves and waves of enemies from the weaker one to the stronger one. The player will have to mantain control and rihtym with the game, and he will be required to be pin point precise whith their strikes, and to do this, you will 
have to use a special controller, of my creation. This controller has multiple points where you will be required to punch in order to score points and to advance the game. The punching pads will inluminate to signal the player has to punch that point, and the in game screen is going to suggest where as well. More the player goes trought the game, more the game is going to become faster.
